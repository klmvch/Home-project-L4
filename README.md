# This is my first project
Author: Tatsiana Klimovich

With this project, we went through the process of creating a project, setting up a basic structure for writing both code and tests.

How to install the project?
1. Clone this repository to your workstation and open it in an editor (VS Code, for example).
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project root.
3. Initialize a new yarn project using the 'yarn init' command.
4. Add the "JEST" testing library:
   - Open https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
   - Copy the command 'yarn add --dev jest'
   - Execute the command from the repository root
   - Check your './package.json' file. You must see the following:
```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^25.5.4",
  }
5. Check for the following folders and files inside the project:
   - 'js' folder
   - 'node modules' folder
   - 'tests' folder
   - '.gitignore' file
   - 'babel.config.cjs' file
   - 'package.json' file
   - 'README.md' file
   - 'yarn-error.log' file
   - 'yarn.lock' file.

How to run the project?
1. Open the terminal in your editor.
2. Go to the source with the project on your work station ('cd' command).
3. Run 'yarn test' command.
Expected result:
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
